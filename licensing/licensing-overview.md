We currently offer 2 different licenses for Awesomium:

 * A **Free License** for free non-commercial use and free commercial-use by indie developers
 * A **Pro License** for use in a single commercial application

Please see one of the sections below for more information:

### Free License

We recognize the importance of Awesomium and want to get into the hands of as many developers as possible. That’s why we’ve made Awesomium **completely free for indie developers**. If your company made less than $100K in revenue last year, you qualify to use Awesomium for **commercial use** free-of-charge.

If you are not an indie developer, but are developing an application for **Non-Commercial Use**, you may also use Awesomium for free.

#### Non-Commercial Use Limitations

 * Cannot be used for products created with the intention for profit
 * Cannot be used for resale or other Commercial distribution
 * Cannot be used for products intended to produce works, services, or data for Commercial use
 * Cannot be used for products that are either conducted or funded by a person or an entity engaged in the Commercial use, application or exploitation of works similar to the software

#### Indie Commercial Use Limitations

If your company ever makes more than $100k in revenue in any subsequent year while using the Free License, you must purchase a Pro License (or other commercial license) to continue using Awesomium in your application.

### Pro License

Our Pro License allows you to use Awesomium in a single commercial application (defined by title), on any platform (Windows and Mac OSX) for a one-time, royalty-free fee of US$2900.

You may use any version of Awesomium v1.X (eg. 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, etc.) in your application with this license.

You can buy this license online [here](https://www.awesomium.com/buy/).
