In this tutorial, we'll load our own HTML into a WebView and display it within a window.

### Start With This Code

It's quite a bit of work to set up an empty Windows GDI or Mac OSX Cocoa application. To save some time we've gone ahead and done some of the work for you.

Start by downloading one of the following frameworks:

 * Download Tutorial Framework for Windows (GDI)
 * Download Tutorial Framework for Mac OSX (Cocoa)

#### Windowed WebViews

It's important to note that we will be using Windowed WebViews (as opposed to Offscreen WebViews) with the Tutorial Framework. These views render directly to a platform-specific graphics surface and capture input as well.
